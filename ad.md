# FLOTTER — AD CREATION BRIEF

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE — READ THIS BEFORE GENERATING ANYTHING

### THE LANGUAGE SEPARATION RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Flotter is an **English learning app**. This creates a strict and permanent two-layer language rule that must be respected in every single poster, regardless of what language the poster is designed for:

| Layer | Language | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Poster text** (headlines, sub-copy, CTAs, labels outside the phone) | The target audience language (Arabic, English, French, etc.) | Headlines in Arabic for Arabic-audience posters |
| **Flashcard content shown on screen inside the phone** | **ALWAYS ENGLISH. NO EXCEPTIONS.** | The English word, English example sentences, English audio |

### WHY THIS RULE EXISTS:
Flotter teaches English. When a poster shows a flashcard on a phone screen, that card is a simulation of the actual product. The product teaches English words to non-English speakers. Therefore the card is always and only in English — because that is what the user is learning.

- The **word on the card** → always an English word (e.g., "RESILIENT", "EPHEMERAL", "TENACITY")
- The **sentences on the card** → always 3 English sentences
- The **waveform / audio label** → always represents English pronunciation
- The **app UI text inside the phone screen** → stays in English (or may show Arabic only for the navigation/menu if depicting the Arabic interface mode — but the card word and sentences remain English regardless)

### WHAT CHANGES PER AUDIENCE:
- The **headline on the poster** (outside the phone) → can be in Arabic or any other language
- The **sub-copy and CTA** (outside the phone) → can be in the audience's language
- The **flashcard on the phone screen** → NEVER changes language. Always English.

### CONCRETE EXAMPLE — Arabic-Language Poster:
- ✅ **CORRECT:** Poster headline in Arabic: "كلمة واحدة كل يوم" — the phone screen shows a Flotter card with the English word **"RESILIENT"** and 3 English sentences below it.
- ❌ **WRONG:** Poster headline in Arabic — phone screen shows a card with an Arabic word or Arabic sentences.

### CONCRETE EXAMPLE — English-Language Poster:
- ✅ **CORRECT:** Poster headline: "Swipe to learn" — phone screen shows **"TENACITY"** with 3 English sentences.
- ❌ **WRONG:** Any version of the flashcard in any language other than English.

### THE VISUAL LOGIC TO INTERNALIZE:
The Arabic (or other-language) text on the poster says *"Learn English."* The English card on the phone screen *is* the English being learned. They must coexist in the same poster — foreign-language poster copy surrounding an English flashcard. That contrast is intentional. It is the product truth. It is the visual story.

**This rule applies to every poster in any language. The card on the phone is always English. Always.**

## 3. BRAND FEEL

**Tone:** Bold. Fast. Direct. Anti-academic. Feels like a social app, not a study app.
**Evoke:** Speed, momentum, effortlessness, intelligence, competitiveness.
**Avoid:** Anything slow, academic, traditional, boring, or childish.
**Colors:** Dark navy (#0F172A) or black backgrounds for energy; electric blue/cyan accent; vivid green (mastered); red-orange (struggled); amber flame (#F59E0B) for streaks; white text on dark.
**Typography:** Extra-bold, large, tight, sans-serif. Numbers oversized. No serif fonts.
**Imagery:** Real people in motion, phones in hand, commuting, waiting, coffee moments. Never "studying at a desk."

## 4. EMOTIONAL ANGLES TO EXPLORE

The poster can target any of these emotions — choose one and own it completely:

- **Speed / Wasted time:** "You have 3 idle minutes. That's enough."
- **Zero effort:** "We did everything. You just swipe."
- **Forgetting:** "Your brain forgets. Flotter doesn't let it."
- **Streak fear:** "Don't break what took 21 days to build."
- **Competition:** "Someone is swiping while you scroll."
- **Identity shift:** "You're not learning English. You're becoming fluent."
- **Compound habit:** "One word a day. Fluent in a year."
- **Real-world confidence:** "The word on the tip of your tongue — you'll have it."
- **Anti-traditional:** "Every other app asks you to do the work. Flotter doesn't."
- **Arabic bridge:** "تعلم الإنجليزية. كلمة واحدة كل يوم." (poster in Arabic, card always in English)

## 5. NON-NEGOTIABLE VISUAL RULES

1. **The flashcard on the phone is ALWAYS in English** — English word, English sentences — regardless of the poster's language. Poster headlines can be Arabic or any language. The card never translates. Ever.
2. Every poster must include the brand name **Flotter** and one CTA: `Start Free`, `Try it Free`, `Swipe to Learn`, or `flotter.app`.
3. Show the swipe interface when possible — it's the most recognizable and compelling visual.
4. Keep poster copy minimal: one bold headline + one short support line. Let the visual do the work.
